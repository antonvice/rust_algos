# Documentation for Matrix Multiplication, Linear Regression, Gradient Descent and Fast Fourier Transform Functions
## This code provides implementations of several numerical algorithms including matrix multiplication, linear regression, gradient descent, and fast Fourier transform.

# Matrix Multiplication
The matmul function takes two matrices represented as vectors of vectors of f64 (i.e., &[Vec<f64>]) and returns their product as a new vector of vectors of f64 (Vec<Vec<f64>>). It first checks that the number of columns in the first matrix matches the number of rows in the second matrix. If not, it will panic.
```rust
fn matmul(a: &[Vec<f64>], b: &[Vec<f64>]) -> Vec<Vec<f64>> {
    // ...
}
  ```
# Linear Regression
The linear_regression function computes the slope and intercept of a line of best fit for a set of points given by two arrays of f64 values representing the input x and output y values, respectively.
```rust
fn linear_regression(x: &[f64], y: &[f64]) -> (f64, f64) {
    // ...
}
  ```
# Gradient Descent
The gradient_descent function implements the gradient descent algorithm to optimize an objective function provided as a closure. It takes an initial guess represented as a vector of f64 values (Vec<f64>), a learning rate (f64), a maximum number of iterations (
usize), and the objective function as arguments. It returns the optimized values as a new vector of f64 values.
```rust
fn gradient_descent<F>(mut x: Vec<f64>, learning_rate: f64, max_iterations: usize, f: F) -> Vec<f64>
where
    F: Fn(&[f64]) -> f64,
{
    // ...
}
  ```
# Numerical Gradients
The numerical_gradients function computes the numerical gradients of an objective function with respect to each input variable. It takes a vector of f64 values representing the input variables and the objective function as arguments. It returns the computed gradients as a new vector of f64 values.
```rust
fn numerical_gradients<F>(x: &[f64], f: F) -> Vec<f64>
where
    F: Fn(&[f64]) -> f64,
{
    // ...
}
  ```
#Fast Fourier Transform
The fft function computes the fast Fourier transform of a vector of complex numbers represented as Complex<f64>values. It returns the transformed data as a new vector of Complex<f64> values.
```rust
fn fft(x: &[Complex<f64>]) -> Vec<Complex<f64>> {
    // ...
}
  ```
